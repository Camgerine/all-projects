# GameMaker Studio Tutorial

The idea was to create a tutorial or cheetsheet for another programming language. The tutorial mostly focuses on GameMaker Studio itself rather than Game Maker Language, however, since writing code is just a small part of what the software allows you to do.

## What is it?

This assignment was a tutorial meant to explain GameMaker Studio, a 2D game engine. The tutorial gives brief instructions on the basics, such as how to create a sprite, and it also explains the differences between GameMaker Studio and its recent successor, GameMaker Studio 2.

## Tools and language used

The tutorial was coded in Markdown using Brackets. I also used GameMaker Studio itself to help create simple instructions.

## Challenges

The main challenge for this assignment was simply a lack of time on my end. I was very busy trying to catch up in my classes, so I wasn't able to do much experimentation in GameMaker Studio when creating this tutorial. For this reason, most of the information provided in the tutorial is very basic.
